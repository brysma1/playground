shitty code written in boredom from classes, i forgot that `expect` existed and ended up using a lot of unnecesary `match` statements (teehee),
so far i like how rust feels, is not that bad for toy code, gotta start thinking in some bigger stuff

also spawning mutiple threads was extremely easy, i don't remember it being that hard on C, but comparatevily is kinda simpler, idk, maybe i
don't remember C that well rn, anyway good shit
